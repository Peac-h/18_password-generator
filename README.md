# Project 17 - Javascript Speaks

This is Javascript Speaker App built with the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.

The App reads the given text and has such controllers as - play, pause, cancel, clear, speech speed. Text can be paused, canceled or cleared any time. The speech speed can also be changed any time, even when in progress.

Responsive for all screen sizes, without a single media query.

**This was my 3rd Javascript project.**
