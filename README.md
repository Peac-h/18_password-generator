# Project 18 - Password Generator

This is Javascript Password Generator App.

The App creates a password from 4 to 30 characters on user's choise. In the password, besides default lowercase characters, can be included uppercase characters, numbers and symbols. If none of them is chosen the app renders an error message.

Light and dark modes available.

Responsive for all screen sizes.

**This was my 4th Javascript project.**
